Refactor Horiseon website to be accessible and have semantic language.

## Horiseon Website: Make it accessible.

The goal of this repository is to add accessiblity to standards to the Horiseon website. The project was built to allow all people to have equitable access to the Horiseon website. This solves the problem of the Horiseon website not being able to support all users. By adding changes to the Horiseon website, I have learned some of the accessibility standards for creating webpages, as well as how to incorporate these accessiblity elements into HTML.
